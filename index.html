      <p>The name is Danniel, I sometimes go by Danny depending on my mood and I'm trying to change careers by learning a skill- web development. There's a demand for this role, the money is good, and I'm hungry to learn more about this.</p>

      <p>With these skills I hope I get the ability to work for myself, or have the ability to work remote due to the skills I've acquired through this bootcamp.

      <p>Let's see if I'm able to figure out this homework, which I'm fnding pretty challenging so far. With some more practice, we'll definitely get there.</p>

      <p>Cheers to a new adventure! </p>
